ggseg_py is a python adaptation of the famous [ggseg](https://github.com/ggseg) R package. ggseg_py facilitates 2D brain plots by making heavy use of geopandas and matplotlib. In a nutshell: ggseg based .rda files containing MULTIPOLYGONS for different brain regions are used to create geopandas dataframes. These dataframes can be easily merged with normal pandas dataframes containing your data for a given ROI.
The package also contains some convenience functions to plot these dataframes using matplotlib.
